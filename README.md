# ldcomparison: a simple package for linkage disequilibrium comparisons


This package contains a few functions for estimating linkage disequilibrium
decay and correlation between populations ("persistency of phase").

It is under sporadic development, and not recommended for use by anyone.


## TODO:

* Write roxygen comments
* Turn phase correlation output into nice data frames
* Plotting function for grouped LD decay
* Plotting function for grouped phase correlation
* Plotting function for simple LD decay
* Scatterplot matrix for phase correlation
